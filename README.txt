Description:
Implementation of value iteration algorithm in order to find the optimal value (V*) for each state grid-world.

File functionality:
driver.cpp(contain main method):
Value_iteration.cpp(contains value iteration algorithm)
Value_iteration.h(header file of Value_iteration.cpp)

Makefile includes:
- a compile rule that compiles and links the project (default)
- a clean rule that removes both the object code(.o) files and the "driver" executable

Run instrucitons:
- open terminal
- navigate to the directory "value_iteration" and run the command "make"
- input the following command:
	
	./value_iteration

Output written to file "answers.txt" using linux pipeline
